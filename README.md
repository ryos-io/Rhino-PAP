# Rhino UI

Rhino frontend to manage load tests.

Used technologies:

-   NPM
-   Webpack
-   Typescript
-   Redux
-   React

It is recommeneded to use VSCode as Code editor.

Don't worry about formatting, the code is formatting with `prettier` when you commit anyway.
Whever you push, `tslint` is run after **test** were executed **successfully**.

## NPM comamnds for development

-   `npm run build` to compile the project
-   `npm run start` to start the webpack devserver with **Hot Module Replacement**
-   `npm run test` to run all tests once with **jest**
-   `npm run test:watch` to run all tests once with **jest**
-   `npm run tslint` to run linter for Typescript
-   `npm run tslint:fix` to auto-fix issues
-   `npm run prettier` to reformat your code (stash your code at least before you run this)
